# handwritten_digit_classification

The MNIST handwritten digit classification project is a foundational exercise in the field of machine learning, particularly valuable for those venturing into the realm of image recognition and deep learning. This project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which comprises a collection of 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale representation of a digit, making the dataset a manageable size for experimenting with various machine learning models, especially neural networks. A typical approach involves using a convolutional neural network (CNN), which excels in capturing spatial hierarchies in images. The objective is to train the model to accurately predict the digit represented in each image. This project not only serves as an excellent introduction to key concepts such as data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation but also provides a practical benchmark for comparing different algorithms in image classification tasks.
